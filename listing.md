Hues allows your users to have their own roles, so they can customize it the way they want. 

Change your role’s color, role’s icon, and role’s name in just a single robust slash command. Our modern bot, handles everything for you even when you want to go back to your original color, original icon, or original role name.

# Commands
#### `/createcustomrole`
